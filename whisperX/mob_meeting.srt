00:00:01,323 --> 00:00:15,207
So, as you see on page 16 of the prospectus, the main component of our Northern expansion strategy involves the absorption of the Gerhardt family syndicate, headquartered in Fargo, N.D.

2
00:00:15,207 --> 00:00:23,469
Now the Gerhardts control trucking and distribution for the entire Northern Midwest.

3
00:00:23,469 --> 00:00:26,149
It's a family business, started in 1931 by Dieter Gerhardt.

4
00:00:30,868 --> 00:00:36,630
Now deceased and taken over in 1950 by his son Otto.

5
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:45,032
Not in the report, but of relevance to this meeting, old Otto had a stroke yesterday on the family compound in North Dakota.

6
00:00:45,032 --> 00:00:47,533
Leaving who in charge?

7
00:00:47,533 --> 00:00:50,334
Unclear.

8
00:00:50,334 --> 00:00:54,415
His wife, Floyd, she's tough, but, you know, a girl.

9
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,931
And then there are the three sons, Dodd, Bear and Rye.

10
00:00:59,931 --> 00:01:04,152
And of course they all want their shot at the throne.

11
00:01:04,152 --> 00:01:17,776
Which the boys in research think provides a tactical opportunity for us to move aggressively to acquire or absorb their operation.

12
00:01:17,776 --> 00:01:22,557
And if you can't, and the current business owners resist,

13
00:01:25,338 --> 00:01:35,121
We liquidate Approved
